The agents performing the actions are mostly controlled remotely trough network by human operators or other agents capable to make-decisions. The main goal of the project is the development and testing such control algorithms and real-time communication protocols that can be applied to network controlled systems. During the control algorithm development we take explicitly into consideration of network induced delays, information loses. In our previous work we focused on the systems with a single hop environment. The proposed algorithms we intend to evaluate in diverse network situation like multi hop wireless networks with static and mobile agent. For this purpose, we would like to use a co-simulation environment Matlab and NS2, or other network simulation

we used two Universal robots (UR3 and UR3e) to perform an assembly during a pick and place movement. To simulate factory conditions, we used a conveyor which feeds different Arucco encoded pieces to the robotic setup. If the desired piece is detected, we estimate an ideal pickup position from which it can be lifted from the conveyor. When both arms have a correct piece, an assembly is performed, which requires a synchronized set of movements from the robotic arms.","tags":["Synchronized robot movement"],"title":"Ericsson BME 5G","type":"project"},{"authors":["Zolt√°n Sz√°nt√≥"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615847713,"objectID":"5c732a269c5b8e48279415a94560c88f","permalink":"https://zszanto.github.io/publication/szanto-2012-robot/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T22:07:32.090501Z","relpermalink":"/publication/szanto-2012-robot/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Robot control using Q-Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594142646,"objectID":"535a32dcfccc9f1900e797c9fd457746","permalink":"https://zszanto.github.io/project/to/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/to/","section":"project","summary":"The main goal of the project is the development of such control algorithms, trajectory generation algorithms and real-time communication protocols that can be applied for robotic systems that work in hazardous environment and are supervised through video-information by human operator.","tags":["Teleoperation","Remote robot control"],"title":"TO","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615847713,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://zszanto.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
